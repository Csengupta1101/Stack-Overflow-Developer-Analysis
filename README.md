### Workflow – 

The flow in which execution of the project will proceed will be described here – 

####	Exploring the Dataset – Reading the dataset on a given variable. Checking it’s rows and columns. The value counts of each.  In our given dataset there are 129 columns and 98855 rows with details.

####	Missing Values – Not all columns and rows will have inputs in them. Finding out these missing values are very important in order to analyze the data properly. The below columns are having the maximum share of missing values. These columns where majority of the values are missing , will not play any significant role in analyzing the dataset , hence they will be removed from the dataset.


1. Time After Bootcamp – 93.27% values are missing.
2. Hackathon Reasons  - 74% Values are missing.
3. Ergonomic Devices – 66% Values are missing.
4. Stack Over Flow Jobs Recommended – 61% Values are missing.
5. AD Blocker Reasons – 65% Values are missing.

####	Other Missing Values – Apart from the above stated columns there are other columns as well with missing values but the share of missing values in them are less than the standard benchmark.

####	Handling Missing Values -  There are several methods using which one can handle the missing values present in a dataset. By analyzing the data it’s evident that the ideal approach for this dataset will be the mode method , where the missing values gets replaced with the most frequent occurred value in that particular column.

####	Research Method –
* Finding values counts of all major aspects.
* Finding which feature is impacting other ones.
* Evaluation of Co relations.
* Visualization with necessary libraries for better understanding.
* Use describe method to find the mean value of assessment of individual priorities. 

####	The Findings -  The findings of the research work done extensively done on the dataset reflects the result as below –

* The majority of applications processed through USA (20721) & India( 13721)
* Although Linux being the ideal companion for a developer , The ratio of OS using is much higher with windows(60698) . Apple(MacOs-20325) and Linux(17684) stands far behind.
